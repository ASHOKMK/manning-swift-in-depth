Source code for Manning's book: Swift in depth

Each chapter has a playground which can be opened with XCode.  Each playground is divided up into pages. 

The source is written in XCode 9 on Swift 4.

If you don't see the pages, press cmd+1 to open XCode's file inspector.

For a better view in XCode, make sure rendered markedup is enabled. You can do this by going to Editor > Show Rendered Markup.

Enjoy and good luck with the exercises!
