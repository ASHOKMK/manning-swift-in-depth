Source code for Manning's book: Swift in depth

Each chapter has a playground per section.  Each playground is divided up into pages. 

If you don't see the pages, press cmd+1 to open XCode's file inspector.

For a better view, make sure rendered markedup is enabled. You can do this by going to Editor > Show Rendered Markup.

Enjoy and good luck with the exercises!
