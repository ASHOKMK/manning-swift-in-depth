Each chapter has a playground which can be opened with XCode.  You may find the source and exercises here.

The source is written in XCode 9 on Swift 4.2.

If you don't see the pages, press cmd+1 to open XCode's file inspector.

For a better view in XCode, make sure rendered markedup is enabled. You can do this by going to Editor > Show Rendered Markup.

Enjoy and good luck with the exercises!
