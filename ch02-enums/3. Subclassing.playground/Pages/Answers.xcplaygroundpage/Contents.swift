 1. A superclass prevents duplication, no need to declare the same property twice. With subclassing you can also override existing functionality.
 2. No need to refactor anything if you add another type. Whereas with subclassing you risk refactoring a superclass and its existing subclasses. Second, you are not forced to use classes.
